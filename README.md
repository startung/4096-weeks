# 4096 Weeks

Having read "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals" by Oliver Burkeman I was inspired to create something to help remind me of the books underlying message that "average human lifespan is absurdly, insultingly brief." It is not as bleak as it sounds, the author uses the book to stress that time-management should not be about how we can crank through as many emails as we can, nor how we can add more things to our todo lists, he focuses on how we can use our finite time (approximately 4000 weeks if we are lucky) to live a more meaningful life.

This project has two sides, the first is physical, and takes the form on a led display, the second a very simple microsite that I can check in on when not at home. By design they look very similar and rely on the fact that 4000 is close to the much more geekily satisfying 4096 (i.e. a 64 by 64 grid).
