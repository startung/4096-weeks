## 4096 Microsite

I little single page site. It takes the start date (i.e. your date of birth) from the URI parameter d. so if you were born on the 13th of January 2000, the you would use [rawlings.cloud/4096?2000-01-13](https://rawlings.cloud/4096?2000-01-13). It is a very simple site that aims to mimic the physical led grid. This is acheived through rendering the grid as an SVG then using JavaScript to alter the SVG to fit the dates.

### Notes

- this could be done without the SVG, by rendering a serives of small divs, however, it is supposed to be an image so I choose to give the div a day off

### Future Plans

- add some key milestones (white leds)
